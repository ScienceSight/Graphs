  An Angular application for getting the coordinates of the points of the graph from the raster image.

## Installation

- Download and install latest LTS version of Node.js.

  To get Node.js, go to https://nodejs.org/.

- Install the Angular CLI.

  To install the CLI, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:

  ```sh
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ```

- Clone or download source code.

- Go to the workspace folder (Graphs) and install project dependencies.

  ```sh
  cd Graphs
  npm install
  ```

- Run the application.

  The Angular CLI includes a server, so that you can easily build and serve your app locally.
  Launch the server by using the CLI command ng serve, with the --open option.
